It is a 1v1 debate; each debater prepares a stance assigned by the OC. Once the debaters have completed their speeches, the audience plays a crucial role and asks questions about the speeches and votes for the side which they think has the upper hand. With more than 70 participants, this is just one of our hugely packed events.",

We believe in starting early, so the workshop is usually open to students from school as well as college. It was conducted online last year, with massive appreciation from participants.",

Each team works to find out who the killer is, while also defending themselves from suspicion. Teams are given clues every round to help them get to the bottom of the mystery, as they are simultaneously led astray by the false constructive of the other teams. The event was held virtually this year and saw 100+ participation.",

On the second day, interested students were able to sit in a one-on-one mock interview, held by the members of the panel.",
