It is a 1v1 debate; each debater prepares a stance assigned by the OC. Once the debaters have completed their speeches, the audience plays a crucial role and asks questions about the speeches and votes for the side which they think has the upper hand. With more than 70 participants, this is just one of our hugely packed events.",

It takes time and skill to cultivate the critical thinking skills debating requires, and to help with that, Incipio is a workshop hosted by The Debating Society, NIT Durgapur. We believe in starting early, so the workshop is usually open to students from school as well as college. It was conducted online last year, with massive appreciation from participants.",

Each team works to find out who the killer is, while also defending themselves from suspicion. Teams are given clues every round to help them get to the bottom of the mystery, as they are simultaneously led astray by the false constructive of the other teams. The event was held virtually this year and saw 100+ participation.",

The first day consisted of a panel discussion, wherein the alumni spoke about the skills necessary for an interview. On the second day, interested students were able to sit in a one-on-one mock interview, held by the members of the panel.",

The participants, as detectives, have to find out the killer and pattern in his string of his killings. However, unless you solve his cryptic puzzles, he is going to take another life. The participants must catch him and not let the killer get away!",
