Participants were asked to send us their arguments either in support or in opposition, which were posted if they abided by the policies of Facebook. The participants with the maximum likes, comments, and shares plus considering OCâ€™s views were chosen to be the winners.We received more than 120 responses and a lot of positive applause from the first years.",

	"desc" : "Renegado is a Turncoat debate, in its essence, where you betray your very own stance; that too, in the same breath. A debater is asked to prepare for both sides on a topic and switch their stance in between while speaking. It's an enthralling debate format that is often touted to be a critical assessment of a debater, wherein his/her arguments and rebuttals need to be equally balanced to furnish a great speech.",

Participants have to be quick and witty to make the cut. Last year, Fictionary gathered over 500 participants. Performances were seen from every year, be it first, second, third, or the final year. We got to see a brilliant display of fast thinkers.",
